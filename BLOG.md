# Family Flow Blog System

This project now includes a Jekyll-like static blog generator that transforms your Family Flow landing page into a complete website + blog platform.

## Quick Start

1. **Write a blog post**: Create a markdown file in the `posts/` directory
2. **Build the blog**: Run `npm run build`
3. **View locally**: Run `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000/blog/`

## Writing Blog Posts

Create markdown files in the `posts/` directory with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
author: "Your Name"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post for previews and RSS feeds"
slug: "custom-url-slug" # Optional - auto-generated from title if not provided
---

# Your Post Content

Write your blog post content here using standard markdown.

## Subheadings work great

- Lists are supported
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `code snippets`

> Blockquotes for important callouts

```code blocks are also supported```
```

## Directory Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ posts/              # Your markdown blog posts
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/               # Generated HTML blog pages (created by build)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/css/         # Blog styling
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts/           # Custom templates (optional)
